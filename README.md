# PDF To Image #

The PDF To Image module provides automatic conversion of
uploaded PDF files to images.
It can be used either to create a snapshot of the front page,
or to generate a gallery of images from each page in the document.

The module provides a new widget for managing PDF file uploads.
It places generated images into a nominated Image field on the same content 
type.
